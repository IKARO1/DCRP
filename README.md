# DCRP
A program to give you custom discord Playing statuses know as Rich presents
Hello thanks for Downloading DCRP!

Download it here:https://github.com/IKARO1/DCRP/blob/main/build.zip

NOTE: the application has to be running in order to show the presents(its takes almost no processing power so just minimize it)
TrayApplication: in order to send DCRP to the task tray, run RBTray(RBTray-4_3/64bit/RBTray.exe) then right click the minimize Butten of DCRP
AutoStart: i recomend puting DCRP and RBTray in the auto start so it starts with your pc!(put it on a 1 minute delay since it will crash without discord open)
